# Movie Info App
## Description
- Project aims to create a Movie Info App.
- In this project, I designed a Movie Info App with jQuery. I provided the movie information with the api I got from the https://www.omdbapi.com/ site.  
 

### User story;

- The user can search by entering the movie name in the search bar.
